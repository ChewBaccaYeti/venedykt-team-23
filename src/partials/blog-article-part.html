                        any and all of your gaming audio needs. But, as with any
                        kind of technology, there is a surplus of options on the
                        market, and not all of them are worth buying. <br></br>
                        To make sure you get your money well spent, we’ve
                        provided a checklist of the major factors or questions
                        you should have answered. After you complete the
                        checklist, you’ll have a much better idea on what to
                        look for in a gaming headset

                        The very first step in this checklist is to decide if
                        you want a pair of gaming headphones or a pair of gaming
                        headsets.
                        <br></br>So what is the difference between gaming
                        headphones and gaming headsets? <br></br>Gaming Headphones
                        = Regular Headphones + Separate Mic Gaming headphones
                        are regular headphones that are used traditionally for
                        music enjoyment. <br></br>However, they possess qualities
                        that are awesome for gaming needs too. <br></br>Audiophilic
                        characteristics such as great micro-detail retrieval,
                        accurate sound stage and immersive sound experience make
                        them feasible to double up as a pair of gaming
                        headphones. <br></br>However, most audiophile headphones do
                        not come with a mic nor do they have any mic attachment
                        slots. <br></br>You will need to get an external mic like
                        the Blue Yeti X for communication support. <br></br>A
                        professional gamer who uses a gaming headphones setup is
                        Ninja, famous for streaming PUBG and Fortnight. <br></br>He
                        uses the Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro with Audio Technica
                        AT2035 Cardioid Condenser Microphone while streaming his
                        games. <br></br>There are several benefits and drawbacks to
                        using a gaming headphones setup for gaming.
                        <br></br>Benefits of Gaming Headphones Higher upsides for
                        audio and mic quality As you have a wider product
                        selection for both the headphones and mic itself, you
                        are able to assemble your gaming setup with the latest
                        mic and headphones.
