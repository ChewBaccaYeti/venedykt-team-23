      The very first step in this checklist is to decide if you want a pair of
      gaming headphones or a pair of gaming headsets.
      <br />So what is the difference between gaming headphones and gaming
      headsets? <br />Gaming Headphones = Regular Headphones + Separate Mic
      Gaming headphones are regular headphones that are used traditionally for
      music enjoyment. <br />However, they possess qualities that are awesome
      for gaming needs too. <br />Audiophilic characteristics such as great
      micro-detail retrieval, accurate sound stage and immersive sound
      experience make them feasible to double up as a pair of gaming headphones.
      <br />However, most audiophile headphones do not come with a mic nor do
      they have any mic attachment slots. <br />You will need to get an external
      mic like the Blue Yeti X for communication support. <br />A professional
      gamer who uses a gaming headphones setup is Ninja, famous for streaming
      PUBG and Fortnight. <br />He uses the Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro with Audio
      Technica AT2035 Cardioid Condenser Microphone while streaming his games.
      <br />There are several benefits and drawbacks to using a gaming
      headphones setup for gaming. <br />Benefits of Gaming Headphones Higher
      upsides for audio and mic quality As you have a wider product selection
      for both the headphones and mic itself, you are able to assemble your
      gaming setup with the latest mic and headphones.
