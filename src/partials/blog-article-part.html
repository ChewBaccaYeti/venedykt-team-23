                        The very first step in this checklist is to decide if
                        you want a pair of gaming headphones or a pair of gaming
                        headsets.
                        <br></br>So what is the difference between gaming
                        headphones and gaming headsets? <br></br>Gaming Headphones
                        = Regular Headphones + Separate Mic Gaming headphones
                        are regular headphones that are used traditionally for
                        music enjoyment. <br></br>However, they possess qualities
                        that are awesome for gaming needs too. <br></br>Audiophilic
                        characteristics such as great micro-detail retrieval,
                        accurate sound stage and immersive sound experience make
                        them feasible to double up as a pair of gaming
                        headphones. <br></br>However, most audiophile headphones do
                        not come with a mic nor do they have any mic attachment
                        slots. <br></br>You will need to get an external mic like
                        the Blue Yeti X for communication support. <br></br>A
                        professional gamer who uses a gaming headphones setup is
                        Ninja, famous for streaming PUBG and Fortnight. <br></br>He
                        uses the Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro with Audio Technica
                        AT2035 Cardioid Condenser Microphone while streaming his
                        games. <br></br>There are several benefits and drawbacks to
                        using a gaming headphones setup for gaming.
                        <br></br>Benefits of Gaming Headphones Higher upsides for
                        audio and mic quality As you have a wider product
                        selection for both the headphones and mic itself, you
                        are able to assemble your gaming setup with the latest
                        mic and headphones.

      Gaming Headphones = Regular Headphones + Separate Mic Gaming headphones
      are regular headphones that are used traditionally for music enjoyment.
      However, they possess qualities that are awesome for gaming needs too.
      Audiophilic characteristics such as great micro-detail retrieval, accurate
      sound stage and immersive sound experience make them feasible to double up
      as a pair of gaming headphones.
    </p>
    <p class="article__text">
      However, most audiophile headphones do not come with a mic nor do they
      have any mic attachment slots. You will need to get an external mic like
      the Blue Yeti X for communication support.
